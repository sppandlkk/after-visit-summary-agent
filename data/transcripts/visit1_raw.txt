Doctor: Hi Mei-Ling, good to see you. How have your blood sugars been lately?
Patient: They've been a bit high after meals, around 160-180.
Doctor: Any side effects from metformin?
Patient: Some stomach upset, mostly when I forget to take it with food.
Doctor: Okay. We'll increase metformin to 500 mg twice daily and have you keep a glucose log.
Patient: Sounds good.
Doctor: I'd also like labs in 3 monthsâ€”A1c and a comprehensive metabolic panel.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: For lifestyle, aim for 150 minutes of moderate exercise weekly and cut sugary drinks.
Patient: I can do that.
Doctor: I'll send the new prescription today.
Patient: Thank you.
Doctor: Let's follow up in 3 months.
