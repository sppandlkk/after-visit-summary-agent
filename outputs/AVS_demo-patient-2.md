# After Visit Summary

**Patient**  
Name: Jane Doe  
DOB: 1975-04-12  
Sex: female  

**Visit Information**  
Date: 2025-08-25  
Time: 09:30  

**History**  
Conditions: Hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus | Medications: Atorvastatin 20 mg tablet

**Diagnoses & Issues**  
Elevated blood pressure (150/95), mild kidney function decline, slightly high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

**Treatment Plan**  
The patient was started on Lisinopril 10mg once daily for hypertension.  Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor. Common side effects include cough, dizziness, and hyperkalemia; serious side effects include angioedema (requiring emergency care) and renal function changes.  The patient should monitor blood pressure, and serum creatinine and potassium levels should be monitored 1-2 weeks after dose changes. The patient should rise slowly from lying or sitting positions to avoid dizziness and report any facial or lip swelling immediately.  The patient should continue taking Metformin for diabetes as previously prescribed. Metformin is a biguanide and common side effects include GI upset (nausea, diarrhea), and metallic taste.  Serious side effects include rare lactic acidosis which should be avoided in patients with severe renal impairment.  The patient should take Metformin with meals; the dose may be titrated to reduce GI side effects.  A1c should be monitored every 3 months until stable and renal function (eGFR) should be monitored at baseline and periodically.  The patient should maintain a low-sodium diet, exercise regularly (at least 30 minutes daily), and monitor weight and blood pressure.  A follow-up appointment is scheduled in 4 weeks to review blood pressure, labs, and potentially adjust the Lisinopril dose.
