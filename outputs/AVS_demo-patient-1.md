**Visit Information**  
Date: 2025-08-25  
Time: 09:40  

**History**  
Conditions: Type 2 diabetes mellitus | Medications: Lisinopril 10 mg daily

**Diagnoses & Issues**  
Type 2 diabetes mellitus with elevated postprandial blood sugars (160-180 mg/dL).  Patient reports some gastrointestinal upset from metformin.

**Treatment Plan**  
Increase metformin to 500 mg twice daily. Take with meals to reduce GI side effects.  Metformin is a biguanide used as a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Common side effects include GI upset (nausea, diarrhea), and a metallic taste.  Rare but serious risk of lactic acidosis; avoid in severe renal impairment.  If persistent GI side effects occur, contact the clinic; extended-release metformin may be an option. Keep a glucose log.  Schedule labs in 3 months (A1c and comprehensive metabolic panel).  Lifestyle modifications include aiming for 150 minutes of moderate exercise weekly and reducing sugary drinks.  Follow up in 3 months.  A1c should be monitored every 3 months until stable; renal function (eGFR) should be checked at baseline and periodically.

**Follow-up**  
Doctor: Let's follow up in 3 months.
